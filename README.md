# JudgmentRateDesktop
This is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust backend and React/TypeScript frontend) that serves as a local calculator for post-judgment interest rates in U.S. federal and state courts. It fetches dynamic federal rates via the FRED API, stores state-specific rates in an embedded SQLite database with an editable management interface for easy updates, performs simple interest calculations based on user inputs (judgment amount, dates, and jurisdiction), and packages as an installable MSI for Windows deployment. Ideal for legal professionals needing quick, offline estimates with manual rate maintenance.
